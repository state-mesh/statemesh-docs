title: "Deployment profiles"

Depending on your workload's performance needs, your budget and how mission-critical is your app, you may choose from a variety of deployment profiles that will determine your final costs and infrastructure performance.
Deployment profiles ultimately specify a required compute node affinity inside the decentralized infrastructure.

A deployment profile is bound to a [Project](../projects/intro.mdx). This means that you can organize all your resources and ensure that all components of your deployment will have the same infrastructure placement (e.g: all in the same datacenter or all on your personal nodes).

When you create or edit a project you will have the option to choose a different profile than the default one (HYBRID):

## Profiles and their main characteristics


#### HPC
- High Performance Computing
- Powerful bare-metal servers, suitable for your mission-critical enterprise apps
- Prices may be higher than on regular deployment profiles
:::info
All resources in the current project will be deployed on the same datacenter.
:::
#### GPU
- Powerful Graphics Processing Units
- Dedicated for AI/ML apps. Mandatory profile for training, fine-tuning or publishing AI models
- Prices are based on GPU compute rather than CPU
#### CLOUD
- Public cloud VMs
- Reliable Virtual Machines created on well-known public clouds
- Prices are usually considerably lower than the ones charged by competitors
#### HYBRID
- A mix between public cloud VMs and personal computers
- The best option if you want to balance high performance with small costs
- Prices are definitely considerably lower than the ones charged by competitors
#### EDGE
- Personal computers
- Less reliable compute units. Being the cheapest option, this profile is perfect for non mission-critical apps
- The cheapest compute power out there
#### MYNODE
- Your own StateMesh registered nodes
- If you are also a node operator on StateMesh you can opt for your own compute for reliability and cost reduction
- Everything you pay for this app goes directly to your wallet


:::tip Pro tip
If you move a resource into a different project which also has a different deployment profile configured, then you must re-deploy it.
