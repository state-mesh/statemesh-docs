# Network Architecture

StateMesh's network architecture is designed for decentralized operation, high availability, and secure communication between all components.

## Regional Structure

### Region Organization
* Distributed global regions
* Local clustering
* Proximity-based routing
* Regional redundancy

### Node Distribution
* Geographic distribution
* Region assignment
* Cross-region communication
* Failover mechanisms

## Network Components

1. **Core Infrastructure**
* Central coordination nodes
* Regional controllers
* Edge nodes
* Gateway services

2. **Communication Layers**
* Control plane
* Data plane
* Management layer
* Monitoring system

### Network Services
* DNS resolution
* Load balancing
* Traffic routing
* Service discovery

## Communication Protocol

1. **Internal Communication**
* Node-to-node messaging
* Control plane protocol
* Data synchronization
* State management

2. **External Communication**
* API endpoints
* Client connections
* External services
* Third-party integration

## Network Security

### Security Measures
* Traffic encryption
* Access control
* DDoS protection
* Intrusion detection

### Protocol Security
* TLS implementation
* Certificate management
* Key rotation
* Security policies

## Performance

1. **Optimization**
* Route optimization
* Load distribution
* Traffic management
* Resource allocation

2. **Monitoring**
* Network metrics
* Performance tracking
* Latency monitoring
* Bandwidth usage

## Best Practices

### Implementation
* Region selection
* Network configuration
* Security setup
* Performance tuning

### Maintenance
* Regular updates
* Performance monitoring
* Security reviews
* Documentation
