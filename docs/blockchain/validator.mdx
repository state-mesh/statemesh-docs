title: "Become a Validator"
---
Validating blocks for the StateMesh network requires an initial amount of MESH tokens. This amount is used as a security deposit to ensure that validators are incentivized to act in the best interest of the network. The more MESH tokens a validator has, the more likely they are to be selected to validate a block.

:::info
The minimum amount required to become a validator is 100,000 MESH.
:::

To become a validator, you must first have a wallet with the required amount of MESH tokens. These tokens can either be purchased on an exchange or delegated to you by StateMesh.

Feel free to contact us on the official [Telegram](https://t.me/statemesh) channel if you would like to become a validator.
