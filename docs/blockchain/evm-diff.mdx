# StateMesh EVM Compatibility

The StateMesh blockchain is built on modified `go-ethereum` (geth) architecture, maintaining full EVM compatibility while implementing Fantom's Lachesis DAG-based consensus for enhanced performance.

## Core Features

- **Complete EVM Support**: Deploy and run any Ethereum-compatible smart contracts
- **Familiar Development**: Use Solidity, existing developer tools, and established standards
- **Fast Finality**: Transactions finalize in ~1 second compared to Ethereum's 12+ seconds
- **Immediate Confirmation**: No need to wait for multiple block confirmations

## EVM Differences

While maintaining core compatibility, StateMesh's EVM implementation differs in several ways:

### Transaction Processing
- **Gas Usage**: 10% of unspent gas is consumed as a disincentive against excessive gas limits
- **Transaction Ordering**: Transactions aren't strictly sorted by gas price across the entire block
  - Transactions within each event are gas-price sorted
  - Events are included based on their topological position in the DAG

### Consensus Architecture
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Asynchronous BFT Proof-of-Stake instead of Ethereum's PoW/PoS
- **Block Production**: ~1 second blocks with immediate finality
- **Pending Blocks**: This concept doesn't exist in StateMesh's consensus model

## Solidity Implementation Details

The following Solidity global variables behave differently in StateMesh:

| Variable           | Behavior                                   |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `block.difficulty` | Always returns 0                           |
| `block.gaslimit`   | Always returns `0xFFFFFFFFFFFF` (infinite) |

## JSON-RPC API Differences

### Block Header Fields

| Field           | StateMesh Behavior                            |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `nonce`         | Always 0                                      |
| `mixHash`       | Always 0                                      |
| `sha3Uncles`    | Always 0                                      |
| `miner`         | Undefined address                             |
| `difficulty`    | Always 0                                      |
| `extraData`     | Always empty                                  |
| `gasLimit`      | Always `0xFFFFFFFFFFFF` (infinite)            |
| `receiptsRoot`  | Always 0                                      |
| `timestampNano` | New field: block's consensus time in UnixNano |

### Unsupported Features
- Pending block retrieval
- `shh`, `db`, and `bzz` namespaces are not available
