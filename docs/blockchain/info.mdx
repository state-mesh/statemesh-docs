The StateMesh blockchain is an L1 EVM chain that uses Fantom's [Lachesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01900) DAG-based consensus for fast finality and high throughput. The chain is secured by a network of validators that stake MESH tokens to participate in consensus.

:::info
The chain is not meant to be a general-purpose blockchain, but rather a specialized chain that is optimized for the needs of the StateMesh network.

The chain is designed to be highly scalable and secure, with a focus on enabling fast and low-cost transactions. It is also designed to be highly interoperable, with support for cross-chain communication and integration with other blockchains, for fast stablecoin bridging and other use cases.

It is however a fully EVM-compatible chain, which means that it can run any smart contract that is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This makes it easy for developers to port existing Ethereum smart contracts to the StateMesh chain, and to build new smart contracts that are compatible with the existing Ethereum ecosystem.
