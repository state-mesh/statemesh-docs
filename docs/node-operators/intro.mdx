Node Operators are the backbone of the StateMesh. They run the nodes that provide computing resources to the network and get paid for any workload served by their node.

A node operator can run one or more nodes. Each node is a separate instance of the StateMesh software that runs on a separate machine. The more nodes you run, the more you can earn. Nodes are classified into different [classes](../getting-started/node-classes) based on the resources they can provide to the network.

To get started as a node operators, you first need a machine. You can run a node on your own machine, or you can rent a virtual or bare-metal machine from existing cloud providers.

We recommend the following cloud providers:
- [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/)
- [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/)
- [Linode](https://www.linode.com/)
- [OVH](https://www.ovh.com/)
- [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/)
- [UpCloud](https://www.upcloud.com/)
- [Latitute](https://www.latitude.sh/)



## Requirements
To run a node, you need a virtual/physical machine with the following minimum requirements:

- CPU: Intel/AMD, 2 cores
- RAM: 2 GB
- Disk: 25 GB
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- 1 MESH

While virtual machines and personal computers/laptop will work, the highest income will be achieved by running nodes on bare-metal servers.

## Running a Node
Please see [Onboarding](./onboarding) for instructions on how to onboard a node on the StateMesh network.
