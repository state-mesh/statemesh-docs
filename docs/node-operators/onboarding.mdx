title: "Run your StateMesh Node"
---

Node onboarding in the process of adding a new node to the network. The minimum requirements for running a node are:

- CPU: Intel/AMD, 2 cores
- RAM: 2 GB
- Disk: 25 GB
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS x64/amd64, kernel 5.15 or higher
- 1 MESH

Nodes can be virtual machines sourced from existing cloud providers, bare-metal machines and personal computers/laptops. We recommend getting bare-metal servers that will be given a higher [node classification](../getting-started/node-classes) and provide higher income because they allow for higher concentration of customer workloads and benefit from SMT (Simultaneous Multithreading), or Hyper-Threading as it's known on Intel CPUs.

Virtual nodes sourced from existing cloud providers already have overcommitment for CPU and RAM resources, which can lead to a lower concentration of customer workloads and lower income. However, they are a good starting point for new node operators.

## Running a new node
The first step is to prepare the machine that will run the node. The machine must meet the minimum requirements listed above.

:::tip
A fresh installation of Ubuntu 22.04 LTS works best. If you already have a machine, there might be conflicting system packages or an unsupported kernel. It's best to always start with a fresh installation of the operating system.
:::

The first step is to login to the [StateMesh Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.statemesh.net) and choose **Register Node** from the side menu or **Become a node operator**. Follow the instructions and guides listed there to complete the onboarding process.

Basically the process involves to connect to your machine via SSH and run the command listed on the console. The command will download and install the StateMesh software on your machine. Once the installation is complete, the node will automatically connect to the network and start serving workloads.

The new node will show up in the console once the onboarding process finished and the node joins the network.

:::info
**It might take up to 5 minutes** for the node the show up in the console. If the node doesn't show up after 5 minutes, please check the **Registration History** section from the **Register node** page for detailed logs and submit a support ticket if needed.

## Get some MESH
To run a node, you need at least 1 MESH. You can get MESH from the [StateMesh Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.statemesh.net) by going to the **My Wallet** menu and clicking on the **Buy MESH** button.

## Set the price and costs for your node
Once the node is up and running, you can set the price and total costs for your node in the node detail page. Just click on the node on your dashboard to access the section.

The cost and price are set in $ per hour and can be changed any time.

The network will suggest the average price for nodes similar to yours. Keep in mind that the algorithm for assigning customer workloads to your node will take into account the price you set and, the [class of your node](../getting-started/node-classes) and the height of your [Time Tower](../architecture/time-towers).

To keep things simple, the height of your time tower is the number of blocks your node has been online. The higher the time tower, the more workloads you will get and the more revenue you will earn.

The network will always schedule customer workloads to the cheapest node it finds in the network. If you se a price too high, you might never get any workloads. Also, setting the price is capped by the network average price, plus a small percentage.

:::tip
We recommend to set a price close to the network average price to get more workloads and earn more revenue.

## Next steps
Once the node is up and running, you will see your revenue in the **Earnings** section of the **My Wallet** page or on the node detail page.
