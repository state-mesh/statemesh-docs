title: "Revolutionizing Decentralized Computing"
---

Build and manage containerized applications without the constraints of centralized control, using a global network of trusted node operators.

Great for:

* AI & MLOps
* Microservices
* Internet of Things (IoT)
* CI/CD
* Edge computing
* Development
* Big Data
* High Availability & Disaster Recovery

## What is StateMesh ?

StateMesh is a fully compliant Kubernetes distribution with the following enhancements:

* **Open Access**: Anyone can join the network as an operator or a cluster owner without any restrictions.
* **Fair Participation**: Operators are ranked based on their active time and contributions, eliminating traditional entry hurdles.
* **Cryptographic Assurance**: Advanced cryptographic techniques like Confidential Computing, Time Towers and VDFs to safeguard the integrity of network operators.
* **Encryption**: Your application files, data, images and secrets are encrypted, so nobody in the network can "steal" your information.
* **Tamper-Proof Environment**: Establish trust through chained VDF proofs, not central authorities.
* **Zero Financial Commitment**: No monetary investment is needed to become an operator - simply contribute your computer, server, or virtual machine.
* **No external dependencies**: The cluster binary is self-contained and does not require any external dependencies. It already includes all the necessary components and addons:
    * containerd / cri-dockerd container runtime (CRI)
    * Flannel Container Network Interface (CNI)
    * CoreDNS Cluster DNS
    * Traefik Ingress controller
    * ServiceLB Load-Balancer controller
    * Kube-router Network Policy controller
    * Local-path-provisioner Persistent Volume controller
    * Spegel distributed container image registry mirror
    * Image encryption
    * Container signing and encryption
    * Host utilities (iptables, socat, etc)

## Why StateMesh ?
Kubernetes is the de-facto standard for infrastructure operations, but it is often associated with high costs, complexity, and centralization. Permissionless Kubernetes is a new approach to Kubernetes that eliminates these barriers, enabling anyone to join the network as an operator or a cluster owner without any restrictions. This opens up new possibilities for building and managing containerized applications in a decentralized, trustless environment.

It also offers a variety of interesting features that you can help increase yor productivity at work and manage your project easily:

* **Decentralization**: Remove single points of failure and control. Embrace a system where power is distributed among all participants.
* **Scalability**: Effortlessly scale your applications across distributed nodes. Handle increasing loads with ease and efficiency.
* **Interoperability**: Seamlessly integrate with your existing systems and technologies. Our solution is designed to complement, not complicate.
* **Economic Flexibility**: Customize compensation models using stablecoins or ERC20 tokens. Automate rewards to node operators at the end of each epoch for sustained engagement.
* **Incubator for Great Ideas**: Get node operators to run your applications in exchange for ERC20 tokens. If they support your idea, and it turns out to be a great one, benefits can exceed expectations.
* **Inclusive Participation**: Break down barriers to entry. Encourage a diverse network of operators by requiring no financial investmentâ€”just a commitment of computational resources.
