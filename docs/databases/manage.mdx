title: Manage your Database
---

import Figure from '@site/src/components/Figure';

Once your database is deployed, you can manage it using the [StateMesh Console](https://console.cloud.statemesh.net) by going to the details page of your database.

## Database Details
General information about the database is available in the cards at the top of the page.

Let's consider the following example:

<Figure
    src="/img/snippets/manage-database.png"
    alt="Database details"
/>

The following information is available:

- **Public endpoint**: Public hostname and port to access your database via internet. (Hover the info icon on the right to see an example on how you can connect using psql cli tool).
- **Internal service endpoint**: Internal hostname and port. Use this to configure access from your apps.
- **Password for postgres user**: The password of the database owner.
- **Status**: The current status and lifecycle stage of the database.
- **Project**: The project to which the database belongs.
- **Resources**: The resources allocated to the database.
