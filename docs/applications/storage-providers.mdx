## StateMesh
This provider can create persistent volumes using our own storage system owned by the StateMesh organization. The data we store is encrypted and replicated across multiple machines for fault tolerance.

This is typically used for sensitive data, because nodes never have access to this data.

Pricing is calculated using the amount of storage reserved in `Gb/h` and data transferred OUT from StateMesh.

## Network
This storage provider stores volume date on multiple nodes in the StateMesh network. It's a block storage option that is replicated and encrypted across the network. Use this option when your data is not sensitive or does not require a high level of resiliency.

## S3 Bucket
This provider can create volumes using an S3 bucket that you provide. This is call Bring Your Own Storage (BYOS) and is useful for storing sensitive data. StateMesh does not store any data from your S3 bucket, only the metadata required to mount the volume.

StateMesh provides a high-performance POSIX cloud filesystem that allows almost all kinds of object storage to be used as massive local disks and to be mounted and accessed on different applications and virtual machines. The cloud filesystem is low-latency, provides high throughput, and is suitable for storing large amounts of data.

:::tip
Our internal benchmarks show that the StateMesh S3 cloud filesystem can provide **10x more throughput** compared to traditional cloud storage filesystems and other S3-backed filesystems.

### AWS S3
AWS S3 supports [two styles of endpoint URI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/VirtualHosting.html: virtual hosted-style and path-style. The difference is:
  - Virtual-hosted-style: `https://<bucket>.s3.<region>.amazonaws.com`
  - Path-style: `https://s3.<region>.amazonaws.com/<bucket>`

The `<region>` should be replaced with specific region code, e.g. the region code of US East (N. Virginia) is us-east-1. All the available region codes can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-available-regions).

:::note
For AWS users in China, you need add .cn to the host, i.e. amazonaws.com.cn, and check this document for region code.

### IBM Cloud Object Storage
When using IBM Cloud Object Storage, you first need to create an API key and an instance ID. The ["API key"](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-manapikey) and ["instance ID"](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/key-protect?topic=key-protect-retrieve-instance-ID) are the equivalent of access key and secret key, respectively.

IBM Cloud Object Storage provides [multiple endpoints](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-endpoints) for each region, depending on your network (e.g. public or private)

### Oracle Cloud Object Storage
Oracle Cloud Object Storage supports S3 compatible access. Please refer to [official documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Object/Tasks/s3compatibleapi.htm) for more information.

### MinIO
[MinIO](https://min.io/) is an open source lightweight object storage, compatible with Amazon S3 API.

For `S3 Bucket URL` we only support path-style MinIO URI addresses e.g. `https://<endpoint>:9000/myfs`

When using Multi-Node MinIO deployment, consider setting using a DNS address in the service endpoint, resolving to all MinIO Node IPs, as a simple load-balancer, e.g. `http://minio.example.com:9000/myjfs`

### WebDAV
WebDAV is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that facilitates collaborative editing and management of documents stored on the WWW server among users.

The `S3 Bucket URL` needs to be set to the endpoint of WebDAV. If basic authorization is enabled, username and password should be provided as `S3 Access Key` and `S3 Secret`

### MySQL
MySQL is one of the popular open source relational databases, often used as the database of choice for web applications. MySQL-compatible MariaDB, TiDB, etc. can be used as data storage.

When using MySQL as a data storage, you need to create a database in advance and add the desired permissions, specify the access address through the `S3 Bucket URL`,  specify the user name through `S3 Access Key` and specify the password through `S3 Secret`.

The full format of `S3 Bucket URL` is `(<host>:3306)/<database-name>`

### PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL is a powerful open source relational database with a complete ecology and rich application scenarios. Other databases compatible with the PostgreSQL protocol (such as CockroachDB, etc.) can also be used as data storage.

When creating a file system, you need to create a database and add the corresponding read and write permissions.

Use the `S3 Bucket URL` to specify the address of the data, use `S3 Access Key` to specify the username, and use `S3 Secret` to specify the password.

The full format of `S3 Bucket URL` is `<host>:<port>/<db>[?parameters]`
