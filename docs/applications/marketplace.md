title: App Marketplace
---
The marketplace is a very useful way to quickly get started with your desired application. It provides a list of applications that are available to deploy on the StateMesh network. You can deploy applications with a single click, and manage them easily.

StateMesh is also working on a feature where users will be able to package and sell their application in the marketplace. This feature will be available soon in the upcoming releases.

## Application templates
Users can choose to save an application they create as a template. This template can be used to deploy the same application multiple times.

## Creating an application from a template
Users can create an application from a template, by going to the marketplace and selecting the template they want to use.
