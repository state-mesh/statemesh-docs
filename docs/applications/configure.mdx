Applications support various configuration options to customize their behavior. This page provides an overview of the configuration options available for applications running on StateMesh.

Application can be configured from the `Configuration` tab in the application details page.

## Container image
Every application running on StateMesh is packaged as a container image. The container image contains the application code, dependencies, and runtime environment. You can use any Docker-compatible container image.

Images can be pulled either from public repositories, or from private repositories that require authentication. You can also build your own images and publish them to a public or private repository and have StateMesh use that image.

To choose an image from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com) choose <Typography component="button" variant="smButton">Search DockerHub</Typography> and enter some search terms.

To use a private image, choose <Typography component="button" variant="smButton">Private Registry</Typography> and enter the registry URL, username, and password.

## Network
Once you've selected your desired container image, you can configure the ports the image will expose from the **Network** section

The following options are available:

- **Protocol**: TCP or UDP
- **Name**: This is the name of the port, and is used to reference the port in other parts of the application configuration.
- **Container Port**: The port the container is listening on.
- **Service Port**: The port to expose the container to other containers / applications.
- **Ingress**: Whether the port is used as the ingress port for public internet traffic to your application. If you enable this, the public DNS name of your application will route traffic to this port.

You can use <Typography component="button" variant="smButton">Use default ports of image</Typography> to pre-fill all ports exposed by the container image.

## Storage
The **Storage** section allows you to configure storage volumes that will be attached to the container.

    alt="Container Storage"
    caption="Add storage volumes to your container"
/>

The following options are available:

- **Name**: The name of the volume. You can create a new volume or use an existing one.
- **Size**: The size of the volume in GB.
- **Mount Path**: The path in the container where the volume will be mounted.
- **Read Only**: Whether the container can write to the volume.
- **Ephemeral**: Whether the volume is ephemeral and will be deleted when the container is stopped.

:::tip
The default storage provider for the volume is **StateMesh**, which means that volumes are provided by the StateMesh organization, using our own network storage system.

The data you store with us is encrypted and replicated across multiple machines. This is typically used for sensitive data, because nodes never have access to this data.
:::

You can switch the storage provider to <Typography component="button" variant="smButton">S3 Bucket</Typography> to bring your own storage using any S3-compatible provider like AWS, Cloudflare R2, etc. StateMesh does not store any data from your S3 bucket.

Please see the [Storage Providers](./storage-providers) page for more information on how each storage provider works and how to configure it.
