# Node Operations

## Initial Setup Requirements

### System Requirements
* Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (required)
* Root or sudo access
* Clean system state
* No existing X environment
* No active shell sessions

### Network Requirements
* Stable internet connection
* Open required ports
* Ability to join mesh network
* Geographic region accessibility

## Node Registration Process

### Pre-Installation Checks
* System verifies there's no X environment
* Checks for existing shell sessions
* Confirms root/sudo access
* Validates system resources

### Installation Steps
1. Obtain installation command from StateMesh console
```
 curl -sfLH "SM_ID: your_key" http://[region-address]:8080/api/start | sh -
```
2. The mesh binary performs:
* Prerequisites validation
* Environment security checks
* System process management
* Network configuration
* Storage encryption setup

### Post-Installation
* Node appears in dashboard
* Temporary password generation
* Certificate storage in TPM
* Network configuration completion

## Node Security

### Process Protection
* Installation process cannot be killed
* Protected against interruption
* Requires reboot for changes
* Automatic process monitoring

### Network Protection
* Private network configuration
* Firewall rules establishment
* Geographic zone assignment
* Inter-node communication rules

### Storage Security
* Encrypted block device creation
* Local key generation
* Memory wiping after mount
* Boot persistence configuration

## Node Maintenance

### Regular Operations
* Monitor node status
* Check resource usage
* Verify proof submissions
* Track earnings

### Security Monitoring
* Check process integrity
* Monitor network status
* Verify encryption status
* Track authentication attempts

## Best Practices

### Operational Guidelines
* Regular system updates
* Performance monitoring
* Security verification
* Resource optimization

### Performance Optimization
* Network tuning
* Resource allocation
* Storage management
* Process prioritization
