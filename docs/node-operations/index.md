# Node Operations

Node operations in StateMesh encompass the core functionalities required to participate as a node operator in the network. This section provides comprehensive guidance on becoming a node operator, registering nodes, and configuring them for optimal performance.

## Overview

Node operators are essential participants in the StateMesh ecosystem who provide computational resources to the network. They can contribute through:

* Virtual machines from cloud providers
* Bare metal servers
* Existing infrastructure

Each node operator maintains their infrastructure while earning rewards through:
* Regular stablecoin payments (USDT)
* Optional ERC-20 token payments
* Performance-based incentives

## Key Components

### Tower Service
Every node operator must run the StateMesh Tower Service to:
* Join the global miner pool
* Submit regular proofs of operation
* Maintain their Time Tower height
* Participate in workload distribution

### Node Registration
Operators can register nodes through two primary methods:
* New VM registration - For cloud-based deployments
* Existing machine registration - For bare metal or pre-existing VMs

### Pricing Configuration
Operators have control over their resource pricing:
* CPU pricing (per hour)
* Storage pricing (per GB/month)
* Network pricing (per TB)
* GPU pricing (when applicable)

### Performance Metrics
Node performance is tracked through several key indicators:
* Tower height - Indicating sustained participation
* Active workloads - Current resource utilization
* Reservation rate - Resource commitment level
* Availability - Operational uptime

## Getting Started

To begin operating nodes on StateMesh:
1. Choose your infrastructure approach (new VM or existing machine)
2. Complete the node registration process
3. Configure pricing and operational parameters
4. Start the Tower Service
5. Monitor performance and earnings

Each of these steps is covered in detail in the subsequent sections of this documentation.
