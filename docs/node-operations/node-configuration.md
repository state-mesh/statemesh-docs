# Node Configuration

After registering your node, proper configuration is essential for optimal performance and earnings. This guide walks through the key configuration areas and best practices.

## Pricing Configuration

Configure your node's resource pricing through the pricing panel:

1. **Instance Price**
* Set base hourly rate for VM usage
* Consider your infrastructure costs
* Review market average prices
* Stay within competitive ranges

2. **Resource-Specific Pricing**
* CPU pricing (per hour)
* Storage pricing (per GB/month)
* Network pricing (per TB)
* GPU pricing (if applicable)

3. **Market Analysis**
* Review average network prices
* Consider regional variations
* Analyze workload allocation patterns
* Adjust based on demand

## Token Acceptance Configuration

StateMesh supports multiple payment methods:

1. **Stablecoin Payments**
* Default USDT payments
* Automated hourly/daily settlements
* Configure minimum payout thresholds

2. **ERC-20 Token Acceptance**
* Enable token payments
* Select risk profile:
    * Low: High-volume traded tokens
    * Medium: Established but lower volume tokens
    * High: New or experimental tokens
* Set token acceptance percentage

## Performance Settings

Configure your node's performance parameters:

1. **Workload Limits**
* Maximum concurrent containers
* Resource allocation limits
* Network bandwidth caps
* Storage quotas

2. **Availability Settings**
* Set maintenance windows
* Configure update policies
* Define workload scheduling rules

## Network Configuration

Optimize your node's network settings:

1. **Connectivity**
* Configure network interfaces
* Set bandwidth limits
* Define traffic policies
* Configure port forwarding

2. **Region Selection**
* Choose primary region
* Set secondary regions (if applicable)
* Configure regional pricing variations

## Monitoring Configuration

Set up monitoring for your node:

1. **Resource Monitoring**
* CPU utilization tracking
* Memory usage monitoring
* Storage capacity alerts
* Network bandwidth tracking

2. **Performance Metrics**
* Tower height monitoring
* Workload success rate
* Response time tracking
* Availability percentage

3. **Financial Tracking**
* Earnings monitoring
* Cost analysis
* Payment history
* Token performance

## Security Settings

Configure security parameters:

1. **Access Control**
* SSH key management
* Network security groups
* Firewall rules
* Service access policies

2. **Update Management**
* Security update policies
* Patch management
* Version control
* Backup configurations

## Best Practices

To maximize node performance:

1. **Pricing Strategy**
* Start with market average prices
* Adjust based on utilization
* Monitor competition
* Regular price reviews

2. **Resource Management**
* Monitor resource usage
* Scale according to demand
* Maintain buffer capacity
* Regular performance checks

3. **Maintenance**
* Schedule regular updates
* Monitor system health
* Perform security audits
* Keep documentation current

4. **Financial Management**
* Track earnings regularly
* Monitor token performance
* Maintain adequate balances
* Plan for expenses

## Next Steps

After completing configuration:

1. Test node functionality
2. Monitor initial workloads
3. Review performance metrics
4. Make adjustments as needed
