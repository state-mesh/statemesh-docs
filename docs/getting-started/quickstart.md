This guide is intended to provide a quick introduction to StateMesh and help you get started with deploying your first application on the platform.

## What is StateMesh ?
StateMesh is the world's first decentralized cloud infrastructure. It replaces traditional data centers with a global network of crowd-sourced node operators, while trying to preserve the same level of functionality, security, and resilience. Think of it like the decentralized version of AWS/GCP/Azure etc.

Due to its decentralized architecture, permissionless nature, and fair participation mechanism, StateMesh represents a significant advancement over existing decentralized computing implementations.

- **Censorship resistance**: Since there is no central authority controlling the network, it is much harder for any single entity to censor or shut down applications running on StateMesh.
- **Privacy and Anonymous Workloads**: Stablecoins (USDC, USDT, etc.) can be used to pay for services without revealing the identity of the payer. This makes it possible to run workloads on StateMesh without revealing the identity of the customer. And since the network is decentralized, there is no single entity that can access or control the data running on the network.
- **Natively Decentralized Workloads**: Anything running on StateMesh is automatically decentralized due to the inherent nature of the network. This means that applications running on StateMesh are inherently more secure and resilient than applications running on traditional cloud providers. This makes it ideal for dApps, validator nodes, and other decentralized workloads.


## The StateMesh Console
The StateMesh Console is the primary interface for interacting with the StateMesh platform. It provides a web-based interface for managing your applications, monitoring your resources, and configuring your network settings. You can access the StateMesh Console by visiting [https://console.cloud.statemesh.net](https://console.cloud.statemesh.net).

## Deploying Your First Application
To deploy your first application on StateMesh, you can choose one of the existing application templates available in the StateMesh Console. Here's how you can do that:

1. Log in to the StateMesh Console using your credentials.
2. Click on the "Add App" tab in the left-hand menu.
3. Choose a template from the list of available templates.
4. Configure the settings for your application, such as the number of replicas, the resource limits, and the network settings. For most cases, the default settings should work fine.
5. Click on the "Deploy" button to deploy your application. Wait a few seconds for the deployment to complete.
6. Access the application using the Public endpoint displayed on the application card or application detail page: `https://<app-name>-<id>.<zone>.statemesh.net`.
