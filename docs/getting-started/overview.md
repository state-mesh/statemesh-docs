# The decentralized cloud

StateMesh is the world's first decentralized cloud infrastructure that replaces traditional data centers with a global network of crowd-sourced node operators, maintaining functionality, security, and resilience similar to AWS/GCP/Azure.

Its decentralized architecture, permissionless nature, and fair participation mechanism offer significant advancements over existing decentralized computing implementations.

Customers will find StateMesh comparable to traditional public clouds. While not yet feature-complete with AWS/GCP/Azure, it provides essential tools for developing, testing, and running workloads, with more features in development.

Unlike centralized cloud providers, StateMesh allows anyone to join and contribute computing resources, with payments in stablecoins (USDT, USDC). This decentralization offers unique benefits:

- **Censorship resistance**: No central authority can censor or shut down applications.
- **Privacy and Anonymous Workloads**: Payments in stablecoins (USDC, USDT, etc.) protect customer identity, and no single entity can access or control data.
- **Natively Decentralized Workloads**: Applications are inherently more secure and resilient, ideal for dApps, validator nodes, and other decentralized workloads.

## Why StateMesh ?

It all started with a simple question while we were working on a decentralized MPC network: "Where can we find people to run nodes for our network to make it truly decentralized ?" It turned out that we couldn't. Nobody was interested in running a node for our product without financial incentives. The alternative was to run them ourselves in various clouds, providing only some geographic distribution and a basic safeguard against censorship and malfunctioning. It was not enough to build a decentralized product. Talking to multiple builders and projects, we immediately realized we were not the only ones having this problem.

Most Web3 builders run their workloads on the big public clouds and struggle to find interested partners to help them decentralize their products. The lack of decentralized options to deploy and run Web3 projects makes Web3 inherently centralized. Any existing cloud can decide to shut down a project unilaterally due to policy violations or other reasons, even without prior notice, leaving builders with limited options to find solutions.

This is why we decided to build StateMesh. An industry that's becoming mainstream and praises decentralization as its core value needs a solution to run its workloads decentralized and protected from censorship at the same time.

**Nobody should be able to shut down your idea, good or bad.**

**Web3 should thrive on the principles of free expression, much like the fundamental right to free speech.**

## Features

### For customers
- **Run Anything**: Applications can be run as containers, virtual machines, or both. Storage can be sourced from the network, or you can provide your own if you have sensitive data or more demanding workloads.
- **Low cost**: StateMesh is up to 10x cheaper than traditional cloud providers, with no hidden fees or lock-in contracts. Pay only for what you use. Our dynamic price algorithm ensures that you always get the best price.
- **Reliable**: Distributed replication and built-in fault tolerance eliminates single points of failure and ensures permanent uptime for your applications.
- **Global Reach**: Similar to public cloud, StateMesh is a global network of operators, enabling you to deploy your workloads closer to your end-users.
- - **Secure by design**: StateMesh is built on a decentralized network of operators, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance. It uses advanced cryptographic techniques to safeguard the integrity of network operators and confidential computing to protect your data. Your images, volumes, and secrets are 100% secure and never revealed to anyone. Node Operators don't have access to running workloads or network traffic. Everything is encrypted.
- **High Performance Durable Storage**: Up to 10x faster than AWS EBS, our encrypted durable storage volumes are unbeatable in terms of performance and price compared to traditional cloud providers.
- **Dynamic ingress**: Configure external igress rules to your application. StateMesh supports HTTPS, TCP and UDP, along with dynamic routing and custom domain names.
- **Bring your own Storage**: For data-sensitive systems, StateMesh provides the option to bring your own S3-compatible storage. Our High Performance storage layer will already know to mount volumes using your storage with no performance penalty.
- **Replicas**: Need to have your application highly available or load-balance the load across multiple containers ? Just configure the number of replicas and traffic distribution algorithm.
- **Helm compatible**: Full Helm compatibility makes migration from your existing Kubernetes environment as seamless as possible.
- **CLI**: StateMesh provides a CLI tool to interact and automate your workloads like deploy applications, and managing existing deployments.


### For node operators
Node operators call sell their unused computing capacity on StateMesh and earn rewards in return. Anyone can be a node operators, there are no practical limitations to join the network, only a minimum hardware requirement.

- **The best returns**: On StateMesh, you can achieve the highest returns in the decentralized cloud computing market. You always get paid in a stablecoin to have predictable earnings.

## Typical Use Cases
Here are some workloads that can be run on StateMesh. It's important to note that this is not an exhaustive list, but a few examples to get you started.

* **Decentralized Applications (dApps)**: Host dApps on a censorship-resistant infrastructure, with enhanced privacy and global accessibility for a truly decentralized web.
* **Node Infrastructures**: Seamlessly host blockchain and other distributed network nodes with high reliability across multiple geographies, to make them truly decentralized.
* **Finance & DeFi Platforms**: Build secure, censorship-resistant financial applications and decentralized finance platforms with global reach.

### Traditional Workloads

* **GenAI, Agents and Machine Learning**: Train, fine-tune, and deploy AI models and agentic ops at scale on a decentralized, permissionless cloud, ensuring high availability and lower latency across regions.
* **Data Processing**: Process massive datasets efficiently using distributed nodes, with built-in fault tolerance and scalability for real-time analytics or batch processing.
* **Microservices**: Deploy and manage microservices in a resilient, distributed environment, reducing downtime and ensuring consistent performance under varying loads.
* **Edge Computing**: Deploy workloads closer to end-users on geographically dispersed nodes, improving response times and enabling real-time decision-making.
* **CI/CD Pipelines**: Run continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines with high fault tolerance, ensuring faster delivery and reliable rollouts.
