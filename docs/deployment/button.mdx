title: "Deploy to StateMesh button"
---

The ‘Deploy to StateMesh’ button enables users to deploy apps to StateMesh without leaving the web browser with minimal configuration. The button is destined to open-source project maintainers who wish to provide their customers with a quick and easy way to deploy a StateMesh app.

The button is for use in README files, and is intended to serve as a replacement to a list of manual steps typically required to configure an app.

#### Adding the button

Add the following to your README file:
```bash
[![Deploy](https://console.cloud.statemesh.net/assets/layout/images/deployStateMesh_green.svg)](
https://console.cloud.statemesh.net/deploy?appname=sample)
```
This specifies the button icon and the StateMesh URL for deployment.

There are some query parameters available for the StateMesh URL:
- **appName:** (Required) Will be used to name the app on StateMesh
- **port:** (Optional) The port on which you are serving the app (Default: 80)
- **subPath:** (Optional) A sub-path inside your repository to deploy

The button icon has the following options:
