# Application Deployment

StateMesh provides a flexible platform for deploying containerized applications. This guide covers the deployment process, configuration options, and best practices.

## Deployment Options

StateMesh offers two primary deployment methods:

1. **Predefined Applications**
    * Ready-to-use application templates
    * Pre-configured settings
    * Quick deployment process
    * Standard configurations

2. **Custom Applications**
    * Full configuration control
    * Custom container settings
    * Advanced networking options
    * Custom resource allocation

## Application Configuration

### Basic Settings
* Application name
* Project association
* Description
* Number of replicas
* Deployment region

### Scheduling Rules
* Node selection criteria
* Replica distribution
* Restart policies
* Resource constraints

### Container Configuration
* Container image selection
* Port configuration
* Environment variables
* Resource limits:
    * CPU allocation
    * Memory limits
    * Storage quotas
    * GPU requirements

## Storage Options

StateMesh provides three storage configurations:

1. **Bring Your Own Storage**
    * S3-compatible storage
    * Custom storage endpoints
    * Full storage control
    * Data persistence

2. **Ephemeral Storage**
    * Temporary storage
    * Destroyed with container
    * Fast I/O performance
    * No persistence

3. **Managed Storage**
    * Platform-managed volumes
    * Automatic backups
    * Data replication
    * Simplified management

## Billing Configuration

Configure application billing:

1. **Payment Methods**
    * USDT payments
    * Token payments
    * Mixed payment options

2. **Cost Management**
    * Resource cost estimation
    * Budget limits
    * Usage monitoring
    * Cost optimization

## Application Management

### Monitoring
* Resource usage tracking
* Performance metrics
* Log management
* Alert configuration

### Configuration Management
* Settings updates
* Scale management
* Version control
* Deployment tracking

### Access Control
* Shell access
* Log access
* Monitoring access
* Configuration access

## Best Practices

1. **Resource Planning**
    * Accurate resource estimation
    * Proper scaling configuration
    * Cost optimization
    * Performance monitoring

2. **Security**
    * Access control implementation
    * Secret management
    * Network security
    * Regular updates

3. **Monitoring**
    * Resource usage tracking
    * Performance monitoring
    * Cost tracking
    * Alert configuration

## Troubleshooting

Common deployment issues:

* **Resource Constraints**
    * Verify resource availability
    * Check quota limits
    * Adjust resource requests
    * Monitor usage patterns

* **Network Issues**
    * Check connectivity
    * Verify port configurations
    * Review security settings
    * Test network access

* **Storage Problems**
    * Verify storage availability
    * Check permissions
    * Monitor capacity
    * Review mount points

## Next Steps

After deployment:

1. Monitor application health
2. Configure alerts
3. Review performance metrics
4. Optimize resources
